          <h2>ABOUT</h2>
          <div>
          <p>BUFF RHINO is a Meme Coin Ecosystem 
            and a Wealth Generation Project on Ethereum L2 Solution
            Arbitrum that has a 
            Hyperdeflationary ERC-20 Token called 
            BUFF TOKEN and an Exclusive ERC-1155 NFT 
            Collection and A Defi Ecosystem build around 
            it. BUFF Means Everything ++ and we will be 
            committing to a BUFFED UP BURNING for the
            BUFF TOKEN and unlike common Burning Coins which
            under the hood burns only a small amount of the token taxes,
            we will be burning a bulk of token taxes and keep burning till
            only 20%% of the Total Supply Remains , i.e Burn 99% of total supply.
          </p>
          <p>
          Along with BUFF RHINO Being a Wealth Generation Project ,
          it is also aimed at being useful to the world. A portion of Token Taxes and Ecosystem Revenue will be
          donated for Noble Works Like Wildlife Conservation Efforts and Disaster Relief Teams and NGOs.This Project is Exclusively made
          to be a Charity Effort for Rhino Conservation as well as other Endangered but not well paid attention to Species.
          </p>
          <h4>Why Rhinos Though?</h4>
          <p>The Founders Believe Dogs , Cats , Monkeys and Other animals as well as pets are already getting the Attention they Need , well they do deserve it but 
            we feel like it often portrays a Bias of Human Nature for Cute/Adorable Appearances of Animals and we often tend to Ignore the Issues Other Non-Attractive Species face due to us Humans.
            We would like to try change that by Trying to Bring out Rhinos to the world Through Crypto and Memes. Also we Chose Rhino as our theme as the Founders being from Places where Rhinos are Endemic and Witnessing the 
            untold challenges they face and also because we think Rhinos are Cool!

      <h2>Tokenomics of BUFF ECOSYTEM</h2>
      <p>BUFF Ecosystem is Comprised of Multiple ERC Standard Tokens and is Designed with Sustainability in Mind that 
        does not dampen growth. We Determined that the Ecosystem Tokens should follow a Deflationary/Fixed Supply Token Econimic Model
        that also has a Auto-Burn System on Every Transaction, i.e 4% of every Transaction is Burned.
        The Ecosystem will flaunt a dual-token system for erc-20 standard in order to keep inflationary pressure on the primary "BUFF TOKEN"
        from farming and Staking Activities, A Primary Token "BUFF" will serve to be the Currency to use within the Ecosystem , and a Secondary Token "BUFF-R"
        will serve the purpose to reward BUFF Ecosystem Users.The BUFF-R will be only have one Currency ie the Primary "BUFF" as it's liquidity pair and the Liquidity will be Sourced from
        Token Tax as well as a Ecosystem Revenue.The BUFF Ecosystem will also Flaunt it's Exclusive Collection of NFTs that are set to provide multiple Exclusive Benefits for it's Holders including
        but not Limited to NFT-Fi and many more.
